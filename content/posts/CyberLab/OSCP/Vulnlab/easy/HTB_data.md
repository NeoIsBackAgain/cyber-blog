# Box Info

Data is an Easy Linux machine that involves exploiting [CVE-2021-43798](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43798), an arbitrary file read via path traversal in Grafana. By exploiting this vulnerability, the database file for Grafana is extracted, and the hashes in the database are converted to a format readable by Hashcat. The hash is then cracked and can be used for SSH access to the target as user boris. The compromised user has the privileges to execute docker exec as root on the system, allowing the user to escalate and obtain root access by adding the privileged flag to running containers and mounting the host filesystem.

### Format Hash

{{< toggle "Tag 🏷️" >}}

{{< tag "Grafana-sqlite-password-decode" >}} get the Grafana hashes and use the grafana2hashcat.py to make the hash salt , so i can give the hash salt to hashcat

{{< /toggle >}}

Grafana stores hashes in a non-standard format. I showed in detail how to make a hash for `hashcat` in [BigBang](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2025/05/03/htb-bigbang.html#crack-hash) using [this repo](https://github.com/iamaldi/grafana2hashcat). I’ll get the username, password hash, and salt:

```
sqlite> select login,password,salt from user;
login|password|salt
admin|7a919e4bbe95cf5104edf354ee2e6234efac1ca1f81426844a24c4df6131322cf3723c92164b6172e9e73faf7a4c2072f8f8|YObSoLj55S

```

I’ll format that into the input format of `hash,salt`:

```
7a919e4bbe95cf5104edf354ee2e6234efac1ca1f81426844a24c4df6131322cf3723c92164b6172e9e73faf7a4c2072f8f8,YObSoLj55S

Now the script makes a hash:

```
oxdf@hacky$ uv run grafana2hashcat.py grafana.hash_salt 

[+] Grafana2Hashcat
[+] Reading Grafana hashes from:  grafana.hash_salt
[+] Done! Read 2 hashes in total.
[+] Converting hashes...
[+] Converting hashes complete.
[*] Outfile was not declared, printing output to stdout instead.

[+] Now, you can run Hashcat with the following command, for example:

hashcat -m 10900 hashcat_hashes.txt --wordlist wordlist.txt
```

### Crack Password

`hashcat` detects the hash format and cracks the boris hash very quickly:

```
$ hashcat grafana.hashes /opt/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting in autodetect mode

Hash-mode was not specified with -m. Attempting to auto-detect hash mode.

Base on database password to find the boris account , use the `sudo -l` to identify the `/snap/bin/docker exec *` can be run by root without password to run any docker command, so we can use the `ps auxx` to know the docker containerd of id namespace (e6ff5b1cbc85) ; therefore, we can get into the containerd by root to use the `fdisk -l` to mount the root 's data in the `/tmp/data1` to get root.txt.
