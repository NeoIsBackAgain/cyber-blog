Hey everyone, I'm Haydon, a CPTS holder and red team employee based in Hong Kong. I've been in the infosec game for a while, but recently, I hit a wall—I failed the OSCP exam. It stung, but I'm owning it and turning it into fuel for the next attempt. If you're prepping for OSCP or any tough cert, this might resonate. No sugarcoating: here's why it happened, what went wrong with my prep, and my plan to crush it next time.

## Why I Failed

The OSCP isn't just a test; it's a marathon that exposes every weak spot in your skills and mindset. Here's my honest breakdown:

1. **The Exam Was Harder Than I Thought** I underestimated the intensity. It's not like other certs—it's raw, hands-on, and unforgiving. The pressure builds, and if you're not mentally prepped, it crushes you.
2. **My Notes Were Trash (Worse Than My CPTS Ones)** Organization matters big time. Mine were a mess, and during the exam, I couldn't find what I needed quickly. It felt like digging through a junk drawer when you need a specific tool.
3. **Too Reliant on Tools, Automation, and Others' Ideas** I leaned way too hard on auto-tools, friends' tips, and external crutches. Result? I lost my own problem-solving edge. There were straight-up 5 hours where I blanked—staring at the screen, no clue what to do next.
4. **Not Enough Machines Practiced = Zero Experience** Theory is one thing; real reps are everything. I didn't grind enough boxes, so when unique scenarios hit, I had no muscle memory to fall back on.
5. **Bad Sleep Schedule** Simple but deadly. Pulling all-nighters or inconsistent rest fried my brain. You can't think clearly on fumes.

## The Real Culprit: My "Shit Notes"

Notes are your lifeline in OSCP. Mine? A disaster:

1. **Order Issues** Sections like AD, Linux Web exploits were jumbled. Nothing flowed logically, so mid-exam, I'd get stuck jumping around.
2. **Incomplete and Unreliable** You know that feeling when you're one step from pwnage, but your notes fail you? Yeah, happened too often. Steps were vague or missing key details.

## My Solution Plan: Time to Level Up

No more excuses—I'm rebuilding from the ground up. Here's the roadmap:

1. **Reorganize the Notes** Starting fresh with a better structure:
   * Port Discovery (keeping it solid—Nmap, etc., works fine).
   * AD (Active Directory exploits and techniques).
   * Web (common vulns like SQLi, LFI, etc.).
   * Windows (specific exploits, priv esc paths).
   * Linux (services, footholds, priv esc). This way, it's intuitive and exam-ready.
2. **Grind 100 Machines with "Growth Notes"** I'll do machines iteratively, updating notes as I go—so they evolve into exactly what I need. No more static docs.
   * Focus on HTB (Hack The Box)—no writeups allowed now, which forces real thinking.
   * Also hitting VulnHub machines (about 40 labs there).
   * Goal: 2 labs per day, pushing my best. I'll track progress and maybe share non-spoiler insights here if it helps the community.

This isn't just about passing OSCP; it's about becoming a better red teamer. If you're in the same boat, drop a comment—what's your biggest OSCP hurdle? Let's chat.

Stay tuned for updates on my progress. Hong Kong infosec crew, hit me up!
